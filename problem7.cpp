/*This problem can be solved using a graph traversal algorithm such as breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS). 
The infinite coordinate grid can be represented as a graph, with cells as nodes and edges connecting neighboring cells.
To check if a cell is accessible to the ant, you can use a function that checks if the sum of the digits in the X coordinate 
plus the sum of the digits in the Y coordinate is less than or equal to 25.

BFS algorithm in C++:

problem 

There is an ant on an infinite coordinate grid. The ant can move 1 cell up (x,y+1), down (x,y-1), left (x-1,y), right
(x+1,y), one cell per step. Cells in which the sum of the digits in the X coordinate plus the sum of the digits in the
Y coordinate is greater than 25 are not accessible to the ant. For example, a cell with coordinates (59, 79) is not
available, because 5+9+7+9=30 which is more than 25.
How many cells can an ant visit if its starting position is (1000,1000), (including the starting cell)?

This code will start from the starting cell, and use BFS algorithm to visit all the accessible cells, printing the coordinates of each visited cell.
