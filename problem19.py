The transitive closure of a graph is a measure of which vertices are reachable from other vertices. It can be represented as a matrix M, where M[i][j] == 1 if there is a path between vertices i and j, and otherwise 0.

For example, suppose we are given the following graph in adjacency list form:

graph = [
    [0, 1, 3],
    [1, 2],
    [2],
    [3]
]
The transitive closure of this graph would be:

[1, 1, 1, 1]
[0, 1, 1, 0]
[0, 0, 1, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 1]
Given a graph, find its transitive closure.

The Floyd-Warshall algorithmmm is a dynamic programming approach that efficiently computes the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices.

It can be adapted to compute the transitive closure by simply tracking reachability instead of path lengths.

Algorithm Steps:
Initialize the Reachability Matrix:

Create an N x N matrix M where M[i][j] = 1 if there is a direct edge from vertex i to vertex j, otherwise 0.
Set M[i][i] = 1 for all vertices i since every vertex is reachable from itself.
Update the Matrix:

For each intermediate vertex k from 0 to N-1:
For each pair of vertices (i, j):
If M[i][k] and M[k][j] are both 1, set M[i][j] = 1.
Time Complexity:
O(NÂ³), where N is the number of vertices.
